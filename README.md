# Airflow Football ETL Project

This project uses Apache Airflow for orchestrating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process related to football data. The ETL process retrieves football-related information, uploads it to an S3 bucket, and triggers a Glue job for further processing.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airflow-football-etl.git
   cd airflow-football-etl

DAG Overview
The main DAG file (dags/football_etl_dag.py) orchestrates the ETL process. It consists of several tasks, including retrieving data, uploading to S3, and triggering a Glue job. The tasks are organized into task groups for clarity.

##The DAG execution flow:
start_operator >> retrieve_task_group >> upload_task_group >> submit_glue_job >> end_operator
start_operator: Initializes the DAG.
retrieve_task_group: Task group for retrieving football data.
upload_task_group: Task group for uploading data to S3.
submit_glue_job: Submits a Glue job for further processing.
end_operator: Marks the end of the DAG execution.
